 left rotation operation on an array of size 

shifts each of the array's elements 

unit to the left. For example, if 

left rotations are performed on array 











, then the array would become 











.
Given an array of 

integers and a number, 

, perform 

left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.
Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of 

(the number of integers) and 

(the number of left rotations you must perform). 
The second line contains 


left rotations.
Sample Input
5 4
1 2 3 4 5

where 5=size  and 4 no of left shifts
Sample Output
5 1 2 3 4
Explanation
When we perform 



left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:
